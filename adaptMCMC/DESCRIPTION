Description: Enables sampling from arbitrary distributions if the log density is known up to a constant; a common situation in the context of Bayesian inference. The implemented sampling algorithm proposed by Vihola (2011) achieves often a high efficiency by tuning the proposal distributions to a user defined acceptance rate.
